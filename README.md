# My Favorite Resources
A Repository to collect and showcases developers' favorite resources to learn a technology. No this is not the [Awesome-list] The idea is to collect the resources that has worked for you, to understand why it worked for you and what do you like the most about it. 

## Guidelines
1. Add resources that you have personally used and loved. 
2. Must add why you love the resource
3. Would be nice if you can also add which parts you found difficult
4. Any other things consumer should keep in mind
5. It can be blogs/videos/courses/ paid/free doesn't matter

> Add a specific resource with respect to a technology e.g., python or domain like "backend engineering". Please do not add broad items or platforms like "udemy", "coursera" etc., We are looking for specific resources people found useful

#### Git
1. [Git No Shit](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
    - Extremely beginner friendly. 
    - Gives the necessary commands that you need to learn to get started and doesn't make you get overwhelemd
    - Beginers often stop with this resource alone hence struggle when real problems hit which is why I suggest the next resource
    
2. [Learn Git not commands](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc)
    - Yes, commands are important to work with but learning the under the hood concepts is largely important. 
    - The article explains it farely simply and easy to consume manner. 
    - Nothing specific

#### Git
1. [Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
    - This is a fantastic way to learn about Git branching because of the physical interaction. The site lets you visualize exactly how your commands are affecting the project.
    - The interactivity of the project is what helped it work for me. It is a lot easier to understand something when you're able to actually use it and see the effects.
    - For complete beginners it might be difficult to translate the lessons from this site directly to a real project, especially one where you are collaborating with other people.
