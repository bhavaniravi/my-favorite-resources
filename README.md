## Guidelines
1. Add resources that you have personally used and loved. 
2. Must add why you love the resource
3. Would be nice if you can also add which parts you found difficult
4. Any other things consumer should keep in mind
5. It can be blogs/videos/courses/ paid/free doesn't matter

> Add a specific resource with respect to a technology e.g., python or domain like "backend engineering". Please do not add broad items or platforms like "udemy", "coursera" etc., We are looking for specific resources people found useful

#### Git
1. [Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
    - This is a fantastic way to learn about Git branching because of the physical interaction. The site lets you visualize exactly how your commands are affecting the project.
    - The interactivity of the project is what helped it work for me. It is a lot easier to understand something when you're able to actually use it and see the effects.
    - For complete beginners it might be difficult to translate the lessons from this site directly to a real project, especially one where you are collaborating with other people.
